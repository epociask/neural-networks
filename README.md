# machine learning algorithms 
Learning machine learning through strategical implementation of different training algorithms 

##  Deep Neural Network
	WIP

## Multiprocessed KNN 
   * Supports up to 4 cores of utulization 
   * Calculates euclidean distance to find closest neighbors 
   * Currently boasts zero support for hyper-parameters
